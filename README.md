# backbone-ractive
Test project for trying work with backbone and ractive in one project. Just for education purpose.

## run
just

```
npm install
bower install
gulp
```

## notes
* I use Gulp + Browserify + Less + Bower for build in this project.
* I do now implement gulp production task, but I know that jss/css minifiers exists )
* Backbone installed via NPM rather Bower cause this: https://github.com/substack/node-browserify/issues/1089
* I use Twitter Bootstrap as css-framework in this project. And include it through Less.
